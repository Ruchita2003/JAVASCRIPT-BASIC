    <h2>Que-1 What is JavaScript?</h2><br>
    <p>Ans- JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, interpreted programming language that is primarily used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
         It is commonly used for client-side development, allowing developers to create interactive elements, manipulate content, and respond to user actions within a web browser. 
        JavaScript enables the creation of responsive and engaging web applications by enabling the modification of content, the handling of events, and the communication with servers for data exchange.

   <h2>Que-2 What is the use of isNaN function?</h2>
   <p>Ans- What is the use of isNaN function?
    The isNaN function is a built-in JavaScript function that is used to determine whether a value is NaN (Not-a-Number). 
    It takes an argument and returns true if the argument is not a number, and false otherwise.

    In JavaScript, the NaN value represents a value that is not a legal number.
     It is a property of the global object and is returned when a mathematical operation results in an undefined or unrepresentable value. 
    It is often the result of attempting to perform an operation that involves non-numeric values.

    <h2>Que-3 What is negative Infinity?</h2>
    <p>Ans- In JavaScript, Infinity is a global property that represents positive infinity. It is a value that is greater than any other number. <br>
        It is the result of a mathematical operation that exceeds the largest representable. <br>
         On the other hand, there is also a corresponding value known as negative infinity, represented by the constant -Infinity. <br>
        It is a value that is less than any other number. <br>

    <h2>Que-4 Which company developed JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>Ans- JavaScript was developed by Netscape Communications Corporation, with the lead designer being Brendan Eich.
         It was created in 1995 as a lightweight scripting language for the Netscape Navigator web browser.
         Originally, it was named "Mocha," but it was later renamed "LiveScript" and finally "JavaScript" to capitalize on the popularity of Java at the time.
        
         JavaScript was created to enable client-side interactions and dynamic content on web pages. 
         It quickly gained popularity due to its simplicity and ability to add interactivity to websites.
          Over the years, it has evolved significantly and is now widely used not only for front-end web development but also for server-side development (Node.js), mobile application development, game development, and a variety of other applications. 
         Today, JavaScript is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.

        <h2>Que-5  What are undeclared and undefined variables?</h2>
        <p>
            Ans-Undeclared variables: These are variables that have been used in code without being formally declared using the var, let, or const keywords.
             When you attempt to use an undeclared variable, JavaScript will either create an implied global variable (in non-strict mode) or throw a reference error (in strict mode). 
            Using undeclared variables is generally considered bad practice because it can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug issues.

            Undefined variables: These are variables that have been declared but have not been assigned a value.
             In this case, the variable exists, but it does not yet hold any meaningful value.
             Accessing an undefined variable typically results in the value undefined.

        <h2>Que-6 User Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?</h2>
        <p>Ans-
            In JavaScript, you can add new elements dynamically to the HTML document using the DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation methods.
             Here's an example of how to create a new HTML element and add it to the document dynamically

            <h2>Que-7 What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</h2>
            <p>Ans- 1. ViewState:
                        ViewState is used to preserve the state of a page and the values of controls on a page across postbacks. 
                        It is used to store the state of the page and its controls in a hidden field on the page itself.
                
                   2.  SessionState:
                      SessionState, on the other hand, is used to store and retrieve user-specific data on the server side.
                      It is used to store user-specific data that can be accessed across all pages in a web application for a particular user session.

                <h2>Que-8 What is === operator?</h2>
                <p>Ans-The === operator is a strict equality operator in JavaScript.
                     It checks whether the two operands are both equal in value and data type. 
                     It returns true if the operands are strictly equal and of the same type, and false otherwise. 
                     For example, 5 === 5 would return true because both the value and the type are the same, whereas 5 === '5' would return false because the types are different.

                <h2>Que-9 How can the style/class of an element be changed?</h2>
                <p>Ans-In JavaScript, you can change the style and class of an HTML element using various DOM manipulation methods. 
                    Here are some common ways to do this:
                
                    1.Changing the style of an element:
                           You can directly manipulate the style property of an element to change its CSS styles.
                            
                    Example:-

                <h2>Que-12  How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?</h2> 
                <p>Ans-In JavaScript parseInt() function (or a method) is used to convert the passed-in string parameter or value to an integer value itself. 
                    This function returns an integer of the base which is specified in the second argument of the parseInt() function.</p>

                    <h2>Que-13  How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?</h2> 
                    <p>Ans-To convert a string of any base to an integer in JavaScript, you can use the parseInt function with the base as the second argument.
                       Exm:- 
                       // Convert a string of any base to an integer
                       const inputString = "101010"; // Your input string here
                       const base = 2; // Specify the base of the input string
                       
                       const result = parseInt(inputString, base);
                       console.log(result); // This will output the integer value of the input string

                    </p>

                    <h2>Que-14 What is the function of the delete operator?</h2>
                    <p>Ans-The delete operator in JavaScript is used to remove a property from an object.
                         It can also be used to remove an item from an array. 
                         exm:- const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
                         console.log(obj); // { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }
                         
                         delete obj.b;
                         
                         console.log(obj); // { a: 1, c: 3 }

                        <p>Ans-JavaScript provides several types of pop-up boxes that can be used to interact with the user.
                            1.Alert Box: The alert() method is used to display an alert box with a specified message and an OK button.

                            2.Confirm Box: The confirm() method is used to display a dialog box with a specified message, along with OK and Cancel buttons.
                             It returns a Boolean value indicating whether OK or Cancel was selected.

                            3.Prompt Box: The prompt() method is used to display a dialog box that prompts the user to input text. 
                            It takes two parameters: the prompt message and the default input value.
                            It returns the text entered by the user.

                        <h2>Que-16 What is the use of Void (0)?</h2>
                        <p>Ans-In JavaScript, void(0) is often used to return undefined. The void operator is used before an expression to prevent the browser from taking any action with the expression that follows it.
                             Using void(0) is a common way to create a quick expression that does nothing and does not return a meaningful value. 
                             This can be useful in scenarios where you want to create a placeholder or a default action for an event, for instance, in HTML event handlers like <a> tags, where you might want to prevent the page from refreshing.
                                Exm:- <a href="javascript:void(0);">Click here</a>

                             </p>
                             <hr>

                             <h2>Que-17 How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?</h2>
                             <p>Ans-To force a page to load another page in JavaScript, you can use the window.
                                location object.
                                 This object provides the ability to navigate to a different URL.
                                 You can set the window.location property to the desired URL, which will cause the browser to load the new page
                                Exm:- window.location = "https://www.example.com";

                                When this line of code is executed, the current page will be unloaded, and the browser will navigate to the specified URL. 
                                This is a simple way to redirect the user to a different page in JavaScript.

                                </p>

                                <h2>Que-18 What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?</h2>
                                <p>Ans-
                                    While the innerHTML property is a convenient way to manipulate the content of HTML elements in JavaScript, it has some disadvantages that developers should be aware of:
                                    
                                    1. Security risks: Using innerHTML can expose your application to security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
                                     If the content being inserted via innerHTML includes user-generated or untrusted data, it could potentially execute malicious scripts embedded in that data.
                                    
                                    2. Performance implications: Manipulating innerHTML can be inefficient, especially when dealing with large amounts of HTML content. 
                                    When you use innerHTML, the entire content of the element is serialized and parsed again, which can impact performance, especially on complex or large pages.
                                    
                                    3. Overwriting existing event handlers: When you use innerHTML to modify the content of an element, it can potentially overwrite any event listeners or data associated with the existing elements.
                                     This can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs in your application.
                                    
                                    4. Loss of previously bound references: If you have JavaScript references to specific elements within the replaced content, those references may become invalid after using innerHTML to modify the content. 
                                    This can result in unexpected behavior and errors in your code.</p>
